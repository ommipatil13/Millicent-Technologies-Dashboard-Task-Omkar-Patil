## How to set up and run the project

I have not included the node_modules in this repository so you have to install them.

# Step 1:
For frontend node_modules - <br/>
```
cd react-dashboard 
npm install
```

# Step 2:
Now start the frontend - <br/>
```
npm run dev
```

Now open any browser and go to this link - http://localhost:5173/
